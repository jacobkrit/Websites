Academy aspires to instil the coaching values to all its graduates
and ensure that all coaching competencies as defined by the ICF and
the EMCC have been mastered in relevance to the course of study
chosen.<br><br>Founded
in 2009, Coaching Evolution International, was a small private entity
that provided coaching to single individuals and small group training
using a coach approach. In 2010, it accepted a collaboration on an
educational level and that was the beginning of the pursuit of
excellence in coach training. In 2013, Coaching Evolution Int’l
acquired its own educational department and soon its own students
starting graduating. The Academy become the first coach training
entity locally to author a coaching programme that was accredited
with the EQA at Practitioner Level by the EMCC
(<a href="#">http://www.emccouncil.org/</a>).<br><br>Since
then, we have modified and enhanced our programme with a number of
features that allow it to attract more and more students from all
walks of life and every corner of the world who wish to either
develop themselves, their business or become professional coaches.<br><br>One
thing we are very proud of and that is the high standards we have at
the Academy. We expect a lot from our students because we do not take
coaching lightly. The courses are intense and demand intellectual
effort and discipline, internal change and efficient performance as
coaches even during their studies. Our motto supports this: “be
ready to make your change within a year, because your clients will
expect you to help them make a change within three weeks!”.</h2>

            <br>(MCC by ICF; Master practitioner by EMCC)</div>
          <p>Anita van Vlerken (1955), originally a social scientist and educator, has been active since 1995 in coaching. She is the founder of the Association for Coaching. Previously she worked as a teacher in secondary and vocational education as a student counsellor at the University of Groningen. She gained her management experience as Director of an organisation for Social Services. In addition, she was twelve years as a member of the Board of Rabobank Surveillance, including six years as chairman.
            <br>
            <br>Anita&nbsp;is fascinated by&nbsp;the question of&nbsp;how&nbsp;people&nbsp;learn.&nbsp;She has also&nbsp;experienced that&nbsp;the theory is&nbsp;often&nbsp;dry&nbsp;and it costs&nbsp;if&nbsp;there are no interactions&nbsp;with practice.&nbsp;But&nbsp;only&nbsp;experience&nbsp;is&nbsp;also&nbsp;not enough.&nbsp; In essence, it&nbsp;all has to do&nbsp;with&nbsp;the ability to&nbsp;establish a connection between the two.&nbsp;Translating the&nbsp;theory&nbsp;into practice&nbsp;and&nbsp;above all&nbsp;reflecting on&nbsp;your&nbsp;experience&nbsp;ensures&nbsp;that you can learn&nbsp;something. Based on&nbsp;your&nbsp;reflection&nbsp;you are&nbsp;able&nbsp;to adapt&nbsp;your behaviour, broaden&nbsp;your horizons and&nbsp;become&nbsp;a better person&nbsp;and&nbsp;a better professional.

          </div>
          <p>I was born in Australia, but completed secondary school in Greece. I hold a <strong data-new-link="true">Postgraduate Degree in Teaching
English to Speakers of Other Languages</strong> from Aston University, Birmingham.
            <br>
            <br>I have&nbsp;lived in Australia, London, Lebanon, the Netherlands&nbsp;and have been also enjoying the beauties of Greek nature throughout the years.
            <br>
            <br>I am a 10km runner, a table tennis finalist and a keen traveller.
            <br>
            <br>For many years I delivered&nbsp;<strong data-new-link="true">empowering
and purposeful teaching</strong>&nbsp;to young children and Business English tutoring to top company executives.
            <br>
            <br>I am an&nbsp;<strong data-new-link="true">executive coach and coach
assessor</strong>&nbsp;specialising in instilling&nbsp;awareness and&nbsp;inner strength to&nbsp;those around me who seek it.&nbsp;Through&nbsp;my “drilling” and challenging coaching I facilitate change by creating an initial profile of my clients and then by helping them tune into&nbsp;their&nbsp;needs, talents&nbsp;and&nbsp;skills. My coaching intervention challenges them to&nbsp;face the&nbsp;music, evolve in a targeted and effective manner, and develop the necessary daily thought patterns to design&nbsp;and&nbsp;implement their&nbsp;personal and professional&nbsp;decisions and turn them into successes.
            <br>
            <br>My coaching assignments and contracts through my British- based company, Coaching Evolution Int'l, has added a breadth of experience to my work since I have travelled to culturally diverse sites such as Venice, Tunisia, Morocco (Casablanca), Algeria (Oran), Istanbul, and the Netherlands (Amsterdam).
            <br>
            <br>My profound interest in the effectiveness of coaching has turned me into a prolific designer of coaching proagrammes (our diploma is conferred the EQA by the EMCC) and tailor-made coach training events, while positive outcomes during the assignments have led to the creation of the company's highly effective coaching method: Explore, Sculpt, Paint©
